    <h1 style="padding: 40px 40px; padding-bottom: 30px;">
        The focus of my story is Ward 17, also known as Capital Ward. 
        I live in this ward, and when we were tasked with creating a data story about our wards,
        I knew right away this was the topic I wanted to cover. 
        A few facts about the ward: Shawn Menard is the Councillor of the ward, it is the oldest currently existing ward in Ottawa, 
        it is located near Downtown Ottawa, and it is home to Carleton University.


       Things to note: This is one day's worth of data. Some data is absent, such as trip cancellations.
       This data was retrieved from the GTFS-RT test feed.
       "Early" refers to a bus that arrives 1 minute or more early. 
       "On-time" refers to a bus that arrives between 1 minute early to 5 minutes late. 
       "Late" refers to a bus that arrives more than 5 minutes late. 
       Early, On-Time, and Late are taken from OC Transpo's definitions of the terms. 
       I added a new category, "Extremely Late", which refers to buses that arrive more than 10 minutes late.
       I did so because when I was going through the data, many bus arrivals were >10 minutes late, which are significant wait times for riders.
       This information is localised to Ward 17 (Capital Ward). On-Time Performance for the entirety of the route is much worse. Vehicles refer to
       the actual machinery. Vehicle =/= Driver. Feel free to hover on the visualizations to get more detail, including seeing samples of the data!
        If you want to see samples of the data, look at the gif below to see how.

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Overall Performance</h2>
            <p style="padding: 5px"></p>
            <p>Here we have three visualizations: Route On-Time Performance, Vehicle On-Time Performance, and Stop On-Time Performance. Routes go in two directions.</p>
            <p style="padding: 5px"></p>
            <p>Route On-Time Performance shows the proportion of trips along the route that are early, on-time, late, or extremely late.</p>
            <p>Vehicle On-Time Performance shows the proportion of vehicles that are early, on-time, late, or extremely late to all the stops they visit for all the trips that they take. </p>
            <p>Stop On-Time Performance shows the proportion of buses that arrive to a particular stop  on-time, late, or extremely late. </p>
            <p>The route that had the most on time bus arrivals was Route 2 going in Direction 1, with an approximately 98% on-time arrival performace, and no extremely late bus arrivals.</p>
            <p style="padding: 5px"></p>
            <p>The route with the least worst on time performance was Route 7 going in Direction 1, 
               with an on-time arrival rate of approximately 43%, less than half of the time. This route was also characterised by frequent early bus arrivals.
               Having taken this route myself, and talking with others that have, I had always assumed that the buses were late, and whilst it 
               does have the highest frequency of late bus arrivals out of all the routes, 
               I suspect that my anecdotal experiences of "late" buses on that route may 
               be due to actually missing my first bus because it came too early and 
               the bus I perceive as "late" is actually the next bus arriving on time. 
            </p>
            <p style="padding: 5px"></p>
            <p> The vehicle data measures the frequency of early, on-time, late, or extremely late arrivals of a bus over all the stops it visit across all trips.
                Many vehicles made only one trip, so some of this data represents multiple stops over a single trip, whilst
                others cover multiple stops over multiple trips.
                It seems vehicles are assigned to a specific route, e.g. Vehicle 1 does 10 trips on Route 5.
                Some vehicles were consistently on time over mutiple trips, such as vehicle 6549. 
                The consistently late vehicles only took one trip, so it's difficult to say.
                Perhaps they were even assigned fewer trips because they are older, less efficient buses? 
                Or maybe the buses are assigned trips at times of day that make it unlikely to be on-time, such as rush hour.
                Something interesting to see is the patterns in lateness. 
                Rarely do individual buses arrive late, early, on-time, and extremely late reguarly.
                Some arrive on-time and early, but never late. Others arrive on-time and late, but never early.
                Could these fluctations be due to the routes they are assigned, or something with the machinery (older bus, smaller buses, route that bus is assigned?)
                More data would get us closer to answering this question.
            </p>
            <p style="padding: 5px"></p>
            <p>
                The stops data tracks all late arrivals at that particular stop.
                For example, if a bus stop is along routes 2 and 10, then this data tracks every bus that stopped there 
                that service routes 2 and 10, for all directions.
                If your stop is SUNNYSIDE / GROSVENOR, good luck!

                The following visualizations show how on-time performance is affected by time from 5AM-8PM.
                If we look at the General Performance visualization, we see that on this day,
                most buses across routes arrived to their stops on time. However, from 5PM to 8PM, 
                we that a large percentage of buses arrive not just late, but extremely late. 
                Slightly more than 1 in 5 buses from 7PM - 8PM arrived more than 10 minutes late!
            </p>
            <p style="padding: 5px"></p>
            <p>
                Route 2 consistently has high on-time arrivals.
                there are several time periods when the buses arrive on-time 100% of the time. 
                From 7AM - 11 AM, buses on Route 2 arrived early 100% of the time!
                At 12PM, this route is a little more than 30%, but those lates were all less than 10 minutes. However from 4PM onwards, increasingly large
                percentages of arrivals on this route are over 10 minutes late.
            </p>
            <p style="padding: 5px"></p>
            <p>
                For route 6, on time performance fluctates quite a bit, but consistently showed more than half of arrivals on time.
                Some time periods have on-time arrivals at approximately 100%, 95%, and 93%.
                Other periods show on-time percentages of 61%.
                Again, in the evenings lateness increases significantly, with arrivals over 10 minutes late comprising a little under 1 in 4 buses.
            </p>
            <p style="padding: 5px"></p>
            <p>
                Out of all the routes, route 7 shows the lowest on-time arrival percentages.
                From 7AM - 9AM, bus on-time performance is around 50%.
                At 7AM, slightly more than 33% of buses are late, some of them being 9 minutes late.
                At 8AM, aprroximaelty 28% of bus arrivals are extremely late. That is,
                a little under 1 out of 3 buses will arrive over 10 minutes late. 
                If you click on the visualization to look at the data, some of these buses can reach up to 16 minutes late!
                A large portion of buses not arriving on time are early, especially at 10-11AM, 1PM-2PM, and 5PM-6PM.
                In some instances, the buses arrive 20 minutes ahead of the scheduled time!
                I find this a bit difficult to believe, and I can accept there were some flaws in my methodology,
                so I will try and review my code to see if there were any errors on my end, and try to collect more data over time,
                as this is only one day's worth. However, if it is true, it would seem that many "late" arrivals or "no-shows"
                are actually the result of extremely early buses being misterpreted as late or cancelled by riders.
                There are windows where on-time performance is 100%, specifically from 2PM-5PM.
            </p>
            <p style="padding: 5px"></p>
            <p>
                Route 10 generally showed high on-time performance, with multiple periods of the day showing 100% on-time arrivals.
                However, from 4PM onwards, we see steady increases in extremely late buses. 
                At 7-8PM, it's almost a coin flip as to whether you'll receive a bus that comes more than 10 minutes late,
                or a bus that comes on time. From 5PM onwards, 1/3 - 1/2 of all buses on route 10 are late, 
                many by times over 10 minutes.

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.20em;">How did I do it?</h2>
            <p style="padding: 5px"></p>
            <p>I used the OC Transpo GTFS-RT Beta Feed to retrieve the real time information.
                Retrieved the information from the API for the entirety of Routes 2, 6, 7, and 10 using a server I created.
                Created a database and hosted it using Supabase.
                Sent the the information I retrieved to my database.
                Used a shapefile I found of Ward 17 on Open Ottawa to get the spatial information.
                Converted that information to a spatial database using QGIS.
                Used a query to filter for the information that fell within the boundaries of the shapefile (Ward 17).
                Used the filtered data to create visualizations in Tableau. 
                Finally, Embedded them into this website!
